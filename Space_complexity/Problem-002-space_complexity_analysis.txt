In this program, we have used one integer variable n and one integer array even[].
If we try to find out even number between 0 to 100 then we need even[101] size array.
If we try to find out even number between 0 to 1000 then we need even[1001] size array.

So, required space depend on array size which is given by n.
So, Space complexity of this program O(n).
